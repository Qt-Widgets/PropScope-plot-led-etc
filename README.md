# PropScope
<img style="float: right;" src="logo-scope.png">
A new interface for the PropScope. https://www.parallax.com/product/32220
The development of the original PropScope seems to be dead and I did not like the host software and it did not run in Linux.

So I created my own version. This includes new software running on the PropScope as well as a host program.

Currently only one COGis used for data aquisitaion so the max sampling rate is only 1MHz.

## Prerequisits:
* Qt5 (5.5 tested on Linux)
* qcustomplot 1.3.1 http://qcustomplot.com/

The current repo is not complete, some of my std-libs are missing.

Here is a screen shot of the current software:
