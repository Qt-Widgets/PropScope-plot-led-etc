# PropScope
A new interface for the PropScope.
The development of the original PropScope seems to be dead and I did not like the host software.

So I created my own version. This includes new software running on the PropScope as well as a host program.

Currently only one COGis used for data aquisitaion so the max sampling rate is only 1MHz.
